# Build Resiliency

## Managing in Times of Crisis
Things that we have no control over can affect our teams' abilities to get their work done. We need to provide the safest workplace that we can to those around us.

### Before a Crisis
- After a teammate is affected by a crisis it can be hard for them to process new information
  - To prepare in advance make sure your team is aware of:
    - Their benefits
      - company sponsored things like EAP, short term sidability, or bereavment leave
      - Make sure you know these so that you can quickly assist your teammate
    - Lead by example
      - Show that it's ok to take a day off for mental health reasons or taking care of whatever you need to do
    - Ask for input
      - Gather feedback on team process
      - Ask the team what they need to stay resilient when things are changing and work to secure those things for them
    - Keep setting expectations
      - Make sure your teammates know what's expected of them whether or not there is a crisis
        - This will make you and them better able to figure out how a crisis would impact their work

### During a Crisis
- If you sense something is off for one of your teammates it's imporant to ask them if you can help in a way that they can easily decline
  - Since you have authority over them, you don't want to force them into talking
- Make sure that you don't respond in a way that requires them to reassure you.
  - This means don't respond with how negatively their issue makes you feel.
  - Show empathy, but don't focus on yourself
- Focus on things that may be helpful for them
  - "Would it be helpful to take the afternoon off?"
  - If it's not obvious ask them how you can best support them.

## Managing Your Energy
### Tracking Energy Levels
- Identify the different categories that your work falls into
  - Color coding meetings and work on your calendar can help with this
  - Try to see how each category affect your energy level
- Try to group like work together to avoid context switching
- Try to distance overly draining work to not burn out

## Reprioritzing Work
Use the Eisenhower matrix to figure out what tasks should be done and when 

|               | Urgent         | Not Urgent                |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Important     | Do these now   | Scheduled these for later |
| Not Important | Delegate these | Eliminate these           |

### Delegating Projects
- Handing off work that might not be perfectly packaged to the right people can help develop their skills
  - Over time this will make them more confident and able to handle bigger, scarier pieces of work
- Make sure your delegate has a support system
  - Tell them how and in what medium you'll support them
  - Tell then that you expect this to be a stretch for them and that your trust that they're capable of doing it.
  - Use a RACI to show the teammate that they're Responsible and that you are Consuled and Accountable

### Saying no
- Limiting when you say "yes" is important to controlling your work intake
- If something is both not urgent and not important it's probably safe to say no to it
- Use your team's priorities and goals to back up your no

## Building a Support Network
- Find people in roles similar to yours that you can lean on for support
  - Other people have likely gone through issues similar to what you might be going through and you can learn from their experience
- Attend local relevant meetups

### First Team Mentality
- The people who report to you are not your "first team"
- Your "first team" is your peers across the organization.
- If you and your team trust each other you do not need to spend all of your time and energy watching their backs, you can focus on working with other leaders to move the organization forward.

## Coaching Questions
- In what ways does your organization support employees in times of crisis?
- What do you need more of at work to help you navigate change?
- Where is most of your energy going right now? What refills it?
- Who do you consider to be an emerging leader on your team? What has held you back from delegating important projects to them?
- What are the biggest gaps in your crew? What can you do to remedy them?
