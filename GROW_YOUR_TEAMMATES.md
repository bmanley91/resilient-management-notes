# Grow Your Teammates
## Mentoring
- lending advice and helpign to problem solve
- Advice needs to be sensitive to needs of the recipient
  - Not all approaches work for all people
    - Race, gender, and others can be a big factor
- Ideal when mentee is new in their role
- Success as a mentor is the mentee's success even if the mentee surpasses the mentor
  
## Coaching
- Asking open questions
  - "closed" questions are Y/N questions
  - "open" questions usually look at the problem not the solution
  - Need to be careful with wording
    - "why" can be judgy
    - "how" can put someone into problem solving mode
    - "what" can be authentically curious
      - "What's most important to you about this?"
      - "What does success look like?"

## Reflection
- Help the other person feel seen or heard and to explore more deeply
- Repeat back to the person
  - "What I'm hearing you say is that you're frustrated with how the project is going. Is that right?"
- Soemtimes you may get reflection wrong. This gives the other person an opportunity to review what they're saying.
  - Maybe they're not describing it clearly
  - Maybe there's a different underlying problem
- Reflection can force/encourage introspection
- Coaching isn't about having the answers or even fully understanding the problem
  - May not feel as effective at first, but has better long-term results

## Sponsoring
- usually done when the person isn't there
  - hear about a project and suggest that person work on it
- Feeling "on the hook" for elevating the person
  - Put your reputation on the line on behalf of them
- Examples
  - Giving visible/public recogniation - company "shout outs"
  - assignign stretch tasks - things just outside their skill set
- Memebers of underrepresented groups are usually over-mentored and under-sponsored
  
## Constructing and Delivering Feedback
- Builds on mentoring, coaching, and sponsoring
  - Need to combine these to give actionable feedback
- Doesn't need to be limited to formal settings like reviews
- Important to refer back to job description language
  - Give feedback against current and next level
- Needs to be specific, actionable, and delivered in a way that can be absorbed
  - critical feedback needs to be delivered in a safe way to not make the person overly threatened
- Feedback Equation
  - **Observation of behavior** + **Impact of Behavior** + **Request or Question** = **Specific Actionable Feedback**
  - Observation
    - Just the facts - no "I feel"
  - Impact
    - Best to focus on one effect, prefereablly one that matters to them
      - Reputation
      - Promotion chances
      - Meeting Users' Needs
    - This is where you can say "I feel"
    - If it's measureable, show it
  - Request or Question
    - Request helps them fix what's wrong but may not trigger introspection.
    - Asking an open ended question can let the person communicate the reason for their behavior or to reflect on it.
  - Specifc Actionable Feedback
    - Scenario: Someone writes short terse emails which makes it seem like they're mad
    - Response:
```
Over the past few weeks, I've noticed that your emails to me contain less than five words on average.

I have a hard time understaing what you mean and I often need to ask for clarification. This adds more time to the overall communication process.

Can you help me understand what you're optimising for?
```

### Coaching Others to Give Feedback
- Coach with open ended questions about what it would look like to give their feedback
- Walk them through the feedback equation
  - Keep asking "and what's the impact of that" 
    - If there's no solid impact then there may not be good feedback to give.
      - Maybe suggest that the person introspect and try to find a different perspective on the matter.

## Striking a Balance
- Build Trust
  - Develop a relationship so that you can best support
- Gain shared context
- Plan an support career growth
- All of theseare required
  - Managers typically focus too much on mentorship when trying to help someone grow.

## When it's not working
- Some people don't care about growing
  - This can be ok until it affects others
- Consider other opportunities in the organization for the person
  - Talk with other leaders
