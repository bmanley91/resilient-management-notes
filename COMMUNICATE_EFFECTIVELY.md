# Communicate Effectively
Front line managers are tasked with communcating with their team as the business and its priorities evolve.

## Planning Communication
Here's a communication template:
- Background
  - The "what" (the most important part of the communication - what's changing)
  - The "why" (the reason for the change)
- People
  - Who knows about this
  - Who will be directly impacted
- Timeline
  - What will be said, to who, how (slack, in person, etc.) and when
- Talking Points

It's worth turning this template into a table to expand the timeline for what message will go out with who's involved, and when they'll go out.

## Delivering Sensitive Information
- Communication for sensitive information should go out as quickly as possible because too many things can go sideways.
  - But they can't go out without planning or the team members may be shocked.
- Figure out the following before communicating:
  - What BICEPS needs may be threatened? Why?
  - What are the first questions they'll ask?
  - If they're not bought in to the change, what can you do to help them get there?
- Tips on crafting the message
  - Map big changes back to the things you know people care about
    - delivering value
    - a opportunity to show leadership aptitude
  - Choose planned words carefully
    - What information is helpful to share to what groups and in what mediums?
    - What questions can be preemptively answered?
  - Plan out who can be informed early on and who can be informed later
  - Optimize for clarity and transparency
