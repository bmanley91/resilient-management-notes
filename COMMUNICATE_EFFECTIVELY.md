# Communicate Effectively
Front line managers are tasked with communcating with their team as the business and its priorities evolve.

## Planning Communication
Here's a communication template:
- Background
  - The "what" (the most important part of the communication - what's changing)
  - The "why" (the reason for the change)
- People
  - Who knows about this
  - Who will be directly impacted
- Timeline
  - What will be said, to who, how (slack, in person, etc.) and when
- Talking Points

It's worth turning this template into a table to expand the timeline for what message will go out with who's involved, and when they'll go out.

## Delivering Sensitive Information
- Communication for sensitive information should go out as quickly as possible because too many things can go sideways.
  - But they can't go out without planning or the team members may be shocked.
- Figure out the following before communicating:
  - What BICEPS needs may be threatened? Why?
  - What are the first questions they'll ask?
  - If they're not bought in to the change, what can you do to help them get there?
- Tips on crafting the message
  - Map big changes back to the things you know people care about
    - delivering value
    - a opportunity to show leadership aptitude
  - Choose planned words carefully
    - What information is helpful to share to what groups and in what mediums?
    - What questions can be preemptively answered?
  - Plan out who can be informed early on and who can be informed later
  - Optimize for clarity and transparency
    - If any groups may be more affected than others, commumicate to them just in advance of the broader group.

### Confidentiality
Before communicating ask yourself:
- Is sharing this information fair to them and other teammates?
- How burdened will this person fell by having this information?
- What's the likelihood that they'll share this information?
- What would be the impact if they misunderstand the message and communicate it out incorrectly?
- Is the person already comfortable with ambiguity, uncertainty and confidentiallity?

### Mialignment
Sometimes you won't necessarially agree with a message you need to communicate.
- Before communicating the message be up front and honest with who is asking you to communicate it.
  - Ask questions you think your team might have
  - Sometimes you can help change things, but sometimes the decision has already been made.
- "Disagree and commit"
  - Requires not sharing your fully honest opinion with your team
    - Should look for an external outlet to vent to
  - Doing what's best for the group - not creating unnecessary friction.
    - This does not mean avoiding _healthy_ friction.

## Choosing Your Medium
### Meetings
- Most important things cannot be communicated solely in an email
- Meetings exist to both push information out and to pull information in
- Sharing information in person in a meeting can cut down on negative gut reactions

### All Hands Meetings
- Useful for getting information out to everyone at once to maintain fairness
- Information should be communicated as clearly as possible given the size of the audience
  - High level description of what's changing
    - "We've decided that next week, we will be reorganizing teams. This is going to mean a few changes for the people here. I want to take the time to walk through it all"
  - Instructions on what to do with questions
    - People will process and react at different rates
    - "We'll have time at the end for any questions that you have and we'll be holding office hours tomorrow if more questions come up."
  - An explaination for the change
    - "Our company's number one goal this year is increasing the number of customers we can onboard, and we realized that our team structure doesn't currently help us achieve that."
  - A list of specific changes
    - as well as what's _not_ changing
  - Answers to questions
    - Try to forsee what questions the attendees will have.

### Email
- Emails can sit around forever, meaning your words will live on
  - This means they're good for setting facts in stone
- Good for meting recaps
  - Let's you make sure everyone is on the same page afet the meeting
  - Outline
    - Stated company line
      - "As mentioned in the all hands, we will be reorging next week"
    - What does this mean in practice?
      - "The checkout and payments team will now both be working on a new checkout user experience and everyone on those teams will report to Sam. The other work on their roadmaps will be on hold until the new UX has been rolled out. No other teams have a new manager and no other projects are affected by this. This will go into affect on Monday."
    - My personal take
      - "In each of the last three team retrospectives, folks shared that they felt blocked on making progress toward the #1 company initiative. Though this reorg will mean some disruption in what we've been working on, I'm toked that it aims to address the friction we've felt!"
    - An invitation
      - "Please come to me with comments and questions. You can find me on Slack, at my desk, and at my ofice hours in the library on Tuesdays!"
- The personal take is very important especially when you aren't 100% on board with the message.
  - This allows you to add vulnerability and honesty while still creating stability and clarity for your team
    - It's important not to be _too_ honest to sew dissent

## Iterating and Evolving
How do you make sure that your message connects with your audience? How do you make sure they absorbed it?

### Repeat yourself
- People rarely remember something the first time that they hear it
  - When an important message goes out, it's your job to make sure they know what's happening even if they don't like or agree with it.

### Coaching Questions
- What are some talking points you use all the time that you can share with some of your peer leaders to make their jobs easier?
- Who can you lean on to help you gut check wording and tone when you need to have a difficult conversation with a teammate?
- What does your manager care about most? How can you translate your team's strategy into that language?
- What's a communication skill, practive, or approach you rarely do, but should do more?
